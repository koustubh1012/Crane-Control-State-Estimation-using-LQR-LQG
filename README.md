# Crane-Control-State-Estimation-using-LQR-LQG
This repository presents the modeling, analysis, and control of a cart–double-pendulum crane system, developed as part of ENPM667 – Linear Systems Theory. The project focuses on stabilizing load swing and cart motion using modern control and estimation techniques, validated on both linearized and nonlinear system models.
